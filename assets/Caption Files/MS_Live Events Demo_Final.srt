00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,716
- Hi, I'm Kelly with Microsoft.

2
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,509
And today we are broadcasting live

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,678
from the United Kingdom's RC Racetrack

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,596
to our global audience.

5
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:16,891
Creating compelling live events may appear simple

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,810
but production teams know all too well

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,980
the complexities in delivering these experiences.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,441
Integrating and operating technical systems,

9
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,985
applications, networks, and onsite personnel

10
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:30,321
can be daunting as well as costly and time consuming.

11
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,699
Microsoft's digital experience solution

12
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,993
helps to simplify the delivery of live events

13
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,745
by removing these complexities

14
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,914
while also reducing required onsite personnel.

15
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,834
Microsoft has partnered with industry leading vendors,

16
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,503
Evertz, MediaKind and Lumen

17
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:48,465
to provide a pre-integrated global solution

18
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,301
that scales for events of any size.

19
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,429
The live events process consists of five phases.

20
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:59,267
Ingest, produce, prepare, distribute, and experience.

21
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,935
These phases span the workflow

22
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,771
from the point of media acquisition

23
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,149
to the in consumer experience on a consumer device.

24
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,984
Each partner plays an important role

25
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,236
in delivering the live event.

26
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,073
This solution also spans multiple locations,

27
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,075
both geographical and virtual,

28
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,869
from the racetrack to Microsoft's Azure cloud,

29
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,829
to the consumer's device.

30
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,790
The workflow commences with MediaKind

31
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,376
acquiring and encoding media from the event location.

32
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,628
The media is then delivered

33
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,338
across a Lumen contribution network

34
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,800
to Evertz's Bravo studio running in Azure.

35
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,968
From there, the raw feeds are mixed together

36
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,470
and the produced output streams

37
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,098
are pushed to MediaKind's Aquila platform,

38
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,849
where they are processed and prepared

39
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,226
for consumer consumption.

40
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,687
The prepared streams are subsequently delivered

41
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,856
across Lumens content delivery network

42
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,067
to the consumer device of choice.

43
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,485
Let's break the solution down,

44
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,569
beginning with Evertz.

45
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,156
Evertz Bravo Studio is a cloud first

46
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,574
virtual production platform

47
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,369
serving as a production studio for our live events.

48
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,787
Residing in the Azure cloud,

49
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,831
Bravo Studio is a collection of resources

50
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,625
you can find in traditional production workflows.

51
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,502
Its simple, intuitive interface

52
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:11,631
can be used by any production to collaborate from anywhere.

53
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,925
Bravo Studios mixes together raw feeds

54
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:17,011
as well as additional content to create a produced stream

55
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,304
for the intended audience.

56
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,475
Let's get back to the track and see Bravo Studio in action.

57
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,811
We have six sources of raw media

58
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,814
and the output for the produced stream displayed.

59
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,276
The sources are comprised of four camera feeds at the track,

60
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,320
our announcer, who is offsite using Microsoft Teams,

61
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,114
and a graphics club.

62
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,324
Through this interface, we can select any source,

63
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,201
preview it, take a transition

64
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,203
and output the result to air.

65
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,664
Watch as we easily switch between the different angles

66
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,540
at the track.

67
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,918
We can also switch audio and overlays here.

68
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,753
We overlay our announcers audio

69
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:54,507
onto the races video feeds to deliver the commentary.

70
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,426
Audio of course requires the ability

71
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,761
to manipulate the audio levels.

72
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,014
Here have an audio mixer which allows us

73
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,807
to alter the announcer's voice

74
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,684
as well as audio coming from the track

75
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,812
to create a pleasing experience for the viewer.

76
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,813
With Bravo Studio,

77
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,441
we can spruce up our production with graphics.

78
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,275
In this case,

79
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,153
we can use a transition to return to the action.

80
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,946
Bravo studio uses co-pilots

81
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,908
to simplify the production workflow for the operators.

82
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,453
We have created a storyboard comprised of three components,

83
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,581
the graphic, transition, and ultimately the camera angle

84
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,875
we wish to use upon completion of the segment

85
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,418
in the rundown.

86
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,129
Let's take this to air and we'll see the graphics countdown

87
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,715
followed by the transition and the live camera feed.

88
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,800
In this demonstration,

89
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,385
we've shown several of Bravo Studio's

90
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,637
virtual production capabilities

91
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,140
that result in a stream ready for distribution.

92
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,643
This stream can be sent either to MediaKind

93
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,771
for distribution to our consumer's favorite digital device,

94
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,856
or to a Microsoft Teams live event

95
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,983
where you may want to support a watch party

96
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,028
or include it in a meeting or presentation.

97
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:00,573
MediaKind's Aquila is a cloud native broadcast quality

98
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,576
OTT streaming as a service platform.

99
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,454
It provides content processing, streaming services,

100
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,040
and enables media monetization.

101
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,335
This robust service is built on Microsoft's Azure cloud

102
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,088
and simplifies the configuration and integration

103
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,590
associated with media processing and streaming.

104
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,636
It also dynamically allocates and scales resources

105
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,554
depending on the workload,

106
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:27,058
allowing for cost optimizations across both Aquila software

107
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,143
and the infrastructure it resides within.

108
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,647
Aquila can be deployed in any Azure region,

109
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,025
providing the services you need where you need them.

110
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,195
Lastly, MediaKind's technology can reduce network bandwidth,

111
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:43,116
player latency, and content delivery network file caching,

112
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,451
thereby improving the consumer's experience

113
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,412
and lowering your operating cost.

114
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,623
Let's use Aquila to create a channel

115
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,166
for our racetrack event.

116
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,501
Starting with a homepage,

117
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,253
we see a list of the streaming channels

118
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,673
representing our racetrack camera angles already running.

119
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,509
The green check mark indicates the channel is running

120
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,636
and there are no alarms.

121
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,847
For each channel, you can see the templates,

122
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,808
source, and Azure region being used.

123
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,893
To create our produced stream,

124
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,938
we must first create a source and then a channel.

125
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,231
From the source screen,

126
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,693
we define a name, input mode, and Azure region

127
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,236
where the source will reside,

128
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,405
and then click add new.

129
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,698
Once the source is created,

130
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,617
the IP address and port information are available.

131
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,619
These will be used by Bravo Studio

132
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,246
to send the produced stream

133
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,124
into the appropriate MediaKind source.

134
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,585
Next, let's create a channel.

135
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,919
From the create channel screen,

136
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,546
we define a new channel name

137
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,715
and select the source we just created.

138
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,300
We then select a template

139
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,678
from the desired preset channel configuration.

140
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,681
In this case, we opt for a standard template.

141
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,100
Templates make it easy to spin up multiple channels

142
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,435
with the same configuration

143
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,146
by predefining the channel's attributes.

144
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,690
A default set of templates is included

145
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,192
and additional customized templates

146
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,152
can be easily added by the customer.

147
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,946
Although we've created our channel,

148
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,031
nothing has been provisioned

149
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,408
within the Azure environment yet.

150
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,534
To provision the channel,

151
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:12,038
the activate or play button is selected,

152
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,874
and the necessary services are deployed into Azure

153
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,418
where they are configured based on our template.

154
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,754
The entire process is fully automated,

155
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,132
and once complete the URLs for the adaptive bit rate streams

156
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,425
are available.

157
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,553
Here we see our channel stream and corresponding URL.

158
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,809
Aquila also supports dynamic ad insertion and blackouts.

159
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,311
Let's demonstrate this manually using this view

160
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,356
where we see multiple streams of the produced content.

161
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,358
The largest window in the top left corner

162
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,819
is showing the video being pulled from the origin,

163
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,737
bypassing the personalization service

164
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,490
that's used for ad insertion and blackouts.

165
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,158
The six streams on the bottom

166
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,911
are all coming from the personalization service,

167
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,372
each representing an audience that is being targeted

168
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:58,418
or blacked out based on geographic region and interest.

169
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,086
By clicking the ad button,

170
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,755
we instruct the platform to insert an ad signal

171
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,799
into the stream in real time,

172
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,717
indicating the start of an ad break

173
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,220
with a duration of 10 seconds.

174
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,764
Each audience will receive a different ad

175
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,267
determined by the ad decisioning server

176
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,727
based on their location and interest.

177
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,938
Some content licensing will require blackouts

178
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,274
to be enforced for a portion of the audience.

179
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,818
In our case, it's based on geography.

180
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,069
Clicking on the blackout button

181
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,822
instruct the platform to insert a different signal

182
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,948
into the stream,

183
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,576
indicating the start of the program to be blacked out.

184
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,910
For a demonstration,

185
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,204
our blackout has a duration of 10 seconds

186
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,707
and as being applied to the Florida zone one region.

187
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,710
So all viewers in that region will get the same slate

188
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,962
indicating their region is blacked out.

189
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,046
The rest of our audience

190
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,340
will continue to receive our racetrack event.

191
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,970
We now have a produced stream ready for distribution

192
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,388
across a global audience

193
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,682
with personalized ads inserted

194
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,310
and geographic blackouts enforced.

195
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,728
- As we mentioned earlier,

196
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,813
this is a a geographically dispersed production

197
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,775
that includes an event location, Microsoft's Azure cloud,

198
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,153
and audience members around the globe.

199
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,281
Broadcasts of this type require low latency networks

200
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,784
to deliver the signal across many discreet locations.

201
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,827
For our car race,

202
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,413
Lumen provides the signal acquisition network Vyvx

203
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,499
for contribution from the event location

204
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,292
to Microsoft's Azure cloud,

205
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,085
as well as the content delivery network

206
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,630
from Microsoft's cloud to the audience.

207
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,173
The network is designed to deliver

208
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,467
reliable low latency connectivity

209
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,677
to help ensure the timely delivery of media

210
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,430
across the camera to consumption workflow.

211
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,851
Lumen's Vyvx Venue Net is installed on premises

212
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,230
at over 240 stadiums and event venues today.

213
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,690
It includes dedicated encoding equipment

214
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,943
and managed video network services

00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,279
with high capacity fiber connections to the Lumen backbone.

216
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,033
Vyvx offers white glove fully managed services

217
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,993
for high profile events worldwide,

218
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,246
with zero tolerance for failure.

219
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,915
The service includes 24/7 booking,

220
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,625
a customer care center,

221
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,834
and self-service portals

222
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,672
to support video delivery anytime and virtually anywhere.

223
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,509
Lumen's content distribution flow begins in the Azure cloud

224
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,426
where the produced streams

225
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,137
can be distributed to multiple types of outlets.

226
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,973
Distribution to television outlets

227
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,058
and multi value programming distributors

228
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,852
typically leverages either the Vyvx fiber network

229
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,105
or teleport services

230
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,731
which are used to reach outlets

231
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,234
not on the Vyvx fiber network.

232
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,278
Alternatively, the Lumen CDN

233
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,406
provides OTT streaming capabilities to online viewers

234
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,367
leveraging Lumen's global IP network backbone

235
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,786
and strong ISP peering relationships

236
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,956
to deliver best in class streaming experiences.

237
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,916
One of the largest CDNs in the world,

238
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,668
the Lumen content delivery network,

239
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:50,131
is globally architect for high availability and low latency.

240
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,549
Its security features include

241
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,509
encrypted delivery over the network

242
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,929
and active monitoring to mitigate security threats.

243
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,849
Additionally, the Lumen CDN can be augmented

244
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,767
with their peer assisted mesh delivery

245
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,644
to enhance quality of service,

246
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:04,729
increase reach,

247
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,648
and enable reliable scaling for flash crowds

248
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,775
during high traffic events.

249
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,278
- Microsoft's Azure cloud is the public cloud

250
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,656
providing the compute, storage, networking and data

251
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,658
to power the solution.

252
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,911
Azure enables producers to dynamically stand up their events

253
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,830
where, and when they need them.

254
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,915
It has the largest geographical footprint

255
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,876
of any cloud provider today,

256
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,171
with over 60 regions, 200 data centers,

257
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,424
and 4 million servers worldwide.

258
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,886
For resiliency, regions are comprised of availability zones

259
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,472
which are data centers geographically close to one another

260
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,683
that have been designed to have no single point of failure.

261
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,353
Azure services such as data and compute

262
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:49,023
contain built in resiliency orchestration services.

263
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,816
Microsoft is also doing our part

264
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,985
to build a sustainable future.

265
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,572
We are making a commitment to be carbon negative by 2030

266
00:10:56,572 --> 00:11:00,284
and to move our historical impact by 2050.

267
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,453
Microsoft's progress benefits you

268
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:06,123
because we emit 98% less CO2

269
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:10,711
and use 93% less energy than on-premises data centers today.

270
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,213
This live event solution

271
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,882
further enables a virtualized production team

272
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,802
to reduce their CO2 footprints.

273
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,846
Equally concerning are the security issues we are facing

274
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,306
from malicious actors,

275
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,642
whether they are nation states or individuals.

276
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:28,145
Microsoft's identity and access management platform,

277
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,271
Active Directory,

278
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,483
is a key component of an effective security policy.

279
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:36,904
And it's used by over 90% of Fortune 500 companies today.

280
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,532
with Active Directory, you will have single identity

281
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,409
spanning all of your applications,

282
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,536
including Evertz Bravo Studio,

283
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,331
MediaKind's Aquila and Lumen networks.

284
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,583
Further authorization can be hardened

285
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,752
with multifactor authentication.

286
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:56,173
AD works for applications both in the cloud and on premise,

287
00:11:56,173 --> 00:12:00,052
enabling universal access to every application.

288
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,096
Microsoft's live event solution

289
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,849
offers four key benefits to producers.

290
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,059
First, this pre-integrated solution

291
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,603
provides a comprehensive set of capabilities

292
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,440
spanning the full camera to OTT workflow

293
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,483
removing operational complexities

and managed service models.

304
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,264
Lastly, the solution is secured

305
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,225
using Microsoft's identity management platform

306
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,852
to support a single identity

307
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,313
across each of the applications.

308
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,648
Further multi factor authentication

309
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,693
helps safeguard access to data and applications

310
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:01,280
while meeting user demand for a simple sign in process.

311
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,409
Microsoft has set ambitious sustainability goals

312
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,495
and has been focused on both emissions

313
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,747
and natural resource usage.

314
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,332
Our leadership in these areas

315
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,043
translates into our customers reaping benefits

316
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,753
when they use Microsoft Cloud.

317
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,132
This concludes our live event from the racetrack today.
